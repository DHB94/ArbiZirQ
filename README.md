- Execute complex multi-hop trades for maximum profit
- Optimize gas costs through intelligent transaction batching

### Statistical Arbitrage
Leverage historical price relationships and mean reversion:
- Analyze price correlations between similar assets
- Identify temporary deviations from normal price relationships
- Execute trades based on statistical models and backtested strategies
